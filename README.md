## Developer Support

This repo consists of 2 separate projects/packages:

1. - [azure-pipelines-language-service](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-language-server/tree/main/language-service) - language service implementation for azure-pipelines
2. - [azure-pipelines-language-server](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-language-server/tree/main/language-server) - language server implementation that dependes on azure-pipelines-language-service

In order to tighten the dev loop you can utilize `npm link` that will sync changes to service package without re-installing.

1. First, install dependencies in the language service and start watching for changes:
   - `cd language-service`
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run watch`
2. Next, link the language service to the language server and start watching for changes:
   - `cd ../language-server`
   - `npm install`
   - `npm link ../language-service`
   - `npm run watch`
3. Now, any changes you make in the service will automatically be reflected in the server

### Connecting to the language server via stdio

There's an option to connect to the language server via [stdio](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server/blob/681985b5a059c2cb55c8171235b07e1651b6c546/src/server.ts#L46-L51) to help with intergrating the language server into different clients.

## Thanks

This project was forked from the [YAML Language Server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server) by Red Hat.
